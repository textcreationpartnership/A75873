            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Amidſt your <hi>Honours</hi> grave and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie intendments for this and other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of much concernement, may you pleaſe to reflect on this diſcourſe. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there be many paſſages therein very conſiderable for theſe and after times: and that they will make much for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing of <hi>our thankefulneſſe to God:</hi> when we behold from what beginnings, in an 100 and few moe yeares, <hi>Gods truth</hi> hath riſen, and Papiſticall and Anabaptiſticall errour faln. It is remarkable that the points by <hi>D. Luther</hi> mainly oppoſed were <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, the Popes boundleſſe power,</hi> merit of <hi>workes, Purgatory, Communion but in one kinde:</hi> all <note n="g" place="margin">When wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cities and Caſtles are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, Villages muſt yeeld. <hi>Iſor.</hi>
               </note> chiefe points and palpably and and undeniably groſſe. And on the other ſide, that he ſtood up againſt the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts rebaptization of themſelves, their not baptizing infants</hi> (as not commanded by Chriſt;) <hi>their having all things in common</hi> (as had the Primitive Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44.) and againſt the <hi>Antinomians hereſies</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:111906:4"/>
concerning the law, and other like erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous fancies. It is alſo obſervable that <hi>Dr. Luther</hi> ſtriking at the <hi>Popes</hi> unlawfull power, never ſought to exalt himſelfe to honour or <note n="h" place="margin">He left his wife and three children in want and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a ſigne thereof.</note> riches. For though, as he ſaith, he himſelfe with other learned men exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Epiſcopall Authority</hi> in viſiting the Churches of <hi>Saxony,</hi> &amp; reforming things amiſſe: yet he knowing his talent fitteſt for the <hi>Chaire of Wittenberg,</hi> never would riſe higher; but wrote a book concerning <hi>Chriſtian Epiſcopacy,</hi> and inſtalled <hi>Nicolas Amſdorf</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Neoburg,</hi> and <hi>George Anhaltinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mersburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in regard that <hi>Luther</hi> ſtudied and read, as Profeſſor, <hi>Philoſophie</hi> of divers kinds, was well verſed in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and in <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Occam</hi> &amp; other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and attained to the <hi>Greek and Hebrew</hi> tongues: he was thereby <note n="i" place="margin">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111906:11"/>
ſent thither was, becauſe his Mother was born there of a worthy and ancient family.<note place="margin">How he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his Grammar learning.</note> There he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Grammar learning, and being of a very quick wit, and by nature fitted for eloquence, he ſoone ſurpaſſed his School-fellows in copiouſneſſe of ſpeech and matter, and excelled in expreſſion of his minde both in proſe and verſe.</p>
            <p>Upon this his taſting the ſweetneſſe of learning,<note place="margin">

            <p>He went to <hi>Erford An.</hi> 1501.<note place="margin">He ſtudied at <hi>Erford, An.</hi> 1501.</note> Where he fell upon the crabbed and thorny <hi>Logick</hi> of that age: which he ſoone attained, as one who by the ſagacitie of his wit, was better able to dive into the cauſes and other places of Arguments then others.</p>
            <p>Here, out of a deſire of better learning,<note place="margin">His courſe in his reading.</note> he read over <hi>Cicero, Livy, Virgil,</hi> and other monuments of ancient Latine Authors. Theſe he peruſed, not as a child, to glean Phraſes from them: but to diſcern what therein was uſefull towards the right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of mans life. And to that end ſeriouſly obſerved the counſels and grave ſentences in thoſe writers: and having a faithfull and ſure memory, what ever he read or heard, he had it ſtill in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for preſent uſe. Hereby he ſo excelled in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111906:12"/>
youth, that the whole Univerſitie admired his wit.</p>
            <p>When at <hi>Erphord</hi> he was graced <note n="a" place="margin">His being M. of Arts, <hi>An.</hi> 1503. or as others, 1505.</note> with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Maſter of Arts</hi> at twentie yeeres of his age, he read, as Profeſſour, <hi>Ariſtotles Phyſicks, Ethicks</hi> and other parts of <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Afterward his kindred ſeeing it fit that ſo worthy indowments of wit and eloquence ſhould be cheriſhed for the publique good, by their adviſe he betooke <note n="b" place="margin">His ſtudy of the Law.</note> himſelf to the ſtudy of the <hi>Law.</hi> But not long after when he was 21. yeeres old, of a ſudden beſides the purpoſe of his parents and kindred (upon an affright from his faithfull mates violent death) he betook himſelf to the <hi>Auguſtine Monks</hi>

It much grieved his parents that ſo excellent parts ſhould be ſpent in a life little differing from death. But for a moneths ſpace no man could be admitted to ſpeake with him.</p>
            <p>Nor was it povertie, but the love of a pious life, which bent his minde to the Monaſtical life. In which though he ſpent his time in the uſual ſchoole learning, and read the Writers upon the Sentences, and in publique diſputations clearly opened their inextricable labyrinths to the admiration of many: yet becauſe in this kinde of life he ſought not to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111906:12"/>
ennoble his fame, but to further his ſtudy of a pious life; he looked into thoſe ſtudies but upon the by; and with much eaſe attained their Scholaſtical methods.</p>
            <p>When on a time in the Library of the Colledge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> meets with a Latine Bible.</note> running over the books thereof in order, he met with a copie of the <hi>Latine Bible,</hi> which he never ſaw before; There with admiration he obſerved that there were moe <hi>Evangelical and Apoſtolical texts</hi> then what were read to the people in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> with great attention he read the ſtory of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> his mother: and began to wiſh, that he was the owner of the like book; which not long after he obtained. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſpent his time on the Propheticall and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall writings, the fountaines of all heavenly doctrine, ſeeking thence to enforme his minde with Gods will, and to nouriſh in himſelf the feare of God, and true faith in Chriſt from true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted grounds.

and down the Citie with a bagge or wallet. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the requeſt of the Univerſitie, of which he had been a member, he was eaſed of that burden.</p>
            <p>He was often cheered up by conference with the ancient Prieſt; to whom he revealed his feares and ſcruples of minde, and heard him diſcourſing of faith at large, and going on; the Creed to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.<note place="margin">The Article of remiſſion of ſinnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> 
               <hi>I beleeve the Remiſsion of ſins.</hi> Which he thus explained. Namely, that a man muſt not onely in generall beleeve that ſinnes are remitted to ſome men, as to <hi>David,</hi> and to <hi>Eſter,</hi> for this the devils beleeve: but that God commands, that we ſhould each man in particular beleeve, that our ſinnes be forgiven us in Chriſt Jeſus.

Yet did he not utterly caſt of the reading of <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Camaracenſis,</hi> writers on the Sentences, but was able to recite them by heart in a manner.

For what could this ſport ſignifie and reſemble, but by the dogs, wicked Popiſh divines, and by the nets, the cunning tricks and wiles by which they ſeeke to catch harmleſſe Chriſtians, as hunters thoſe ſilly creatures? This was a moſt evident myſterie of the purſuing of plain hearted and faithfull ſouls. Yet was there a more cruell myſterie preſented to me: When by my meanes, we kept a young Hare alive; and put her in my Coats ſleeve, and ſo left her: in the meane time the dogs finding it, broke one of her legs, and taking her by the

as ſhe was in the ſleeve, ſtopt her wind. Thus it is with Satan and the Pope, who cruelly deſtroy poore ſouls without regard of my paines to ſave them.

This <hi>Luther</hi> ſhewed to be well decreed, but could never be effected: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wanted learned men. Concerning that which they decreed about books, he rejected it not: ſo that the decree did not extend to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred books of the Scripture; the publiſhing whereof was in no wiſe to be prohibited.

For they will take our graunts in the large, larger, largeſt ſenſe: and hold their own ſtrictly, more ſtrictly, and as ſtrictly as they can. In briefe, I wholly diſlike this agitation for concord in doctrin, as being a thing utterly impoſsible, unleſſe the Pope will aboliſh his Popedome.

               <p>For a concluſion I will here adde <hi>Melancthons</hi> judgement concerning the Talents by God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on <hi>Luther</hi> and others. <hi>Pomeranus,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Camerarius</hi> in <hi>Melancth.</hi> life pag. 251.</note> 
                  <hi>what ever he writeth it, peirceth mens minds and leaves behind it a wonderfull ſting in their hearts.</hi> And <hi>Camerarius</hi> ſpeaketh thus of <hi>Luther. The name of</hi> Luther <hi>is ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to ſome, that they deteſt the hearing it: on the contrary other endure not that any thing ſhould be found fault with, which either he ſpeak or did: &amp; if any man dare ſpeake againſt him, they declaime againſt him preſently, as one guilty of impiety. They who thus extoll the name and authority of</hi> Martin Luther, <hi>as not doubting to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate him above the condition and meaſure of Mortall men, ſhould ſee to it, that they doe not wrong the good name of ſo excellent and admirable a man by attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:111906:83"/>
too much to him: and that they doe not ſeeme to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and protect their audaciouſneſſe, under his excellency. And thoſe calumniators, who not onely condemne all his writings as ungodly and turbulent, now alſo, if they had any wit, might remember and conſider, what is gotten by bitter envie, contumacy, froward oppoſition and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious clamours.</hi>
